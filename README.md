<h3 align="left">🍎 Snap Drai - AI Nutritional Assistant</h3>
<p align="left">
  I idealized and developed this mobile application to revolutionize diet tracking by eliminating manual data entry. The app utilizes <strong>Multimodal Generative AI</strong> to analyze meals through real-time images and voice commands, automatically calculating calories and macronutrients. Additionally, I implemented a local notification system for hydration reminders to increase daily user retention.

<h3 align="left">🏆 Launch of EduPay Shop (Agenda Edu)</h3>
<p align="left">I worked in several teams at the company, one of them being the Marketplace Team. In this team, I acted as the sole mobile developer alongside a designer and PM, where I collaborated in discussions and decision-making regarding technologies, design, and business rules for launching a new product built entirely from scratch. The prototyping and full launch were completed in about 3 months.</p>
<p align="left">Since we didn't have a backend in our squad and wanted to validate the proposal as quickly as possible without building an entire database structure, we decided to use Strapi, an open-source headless CMS. It allowed us to create a JavaScript API to be consumed by the mobile application, all through a simple and direct graphical user interface.</p>

**<p align="left">As a result, the product, which was an e-commerce platform, generated around R$600,000 in TPV within its first 6 months of operation.</p>**
